## Trivial problems with launch the project

### File owner or file rights
If shows you somthing similar to this error that presents below, the problem is probably with files owners or files rights.

```
Warning: include_once(/home/user/public_html/e14/strona/methods.php): failed to open stream: Permission denied in /home/user/public_html/e14/strona/index.php on line 14 Warning: include_once(): Failed opening 'methods.php' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /home/user/public_html/e14/strona/index.php on line 14 Fatal error: Call to undefined function connect_db() in /home/user/public_html/e14/strona/index.php on line 30
```

**Solution**

  * Check by `ls -al` program owners and rights for files.
  * Files should be for example with 664 and folders with 775 rights.

```bash
$ find ~/public_html/e14 -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
$ find ~/public_html/e14 -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

### Database error connection
If similar problem to this present below appears then try to solve it by solution also present below this code.

Warning: mysqli::mysqli(): (42000/1049): Unknown database 'e14-database' in /home/user/public_html/e14/strona/methods.php on line 20 Blad: Polaczenie z baza danych nie powiodlo sie.
MySQLi connect error: Unknown database 'e14-database'

This problem is caused by wrong database name or missing database.

  * If variables are correct then reload the database schema, then reload website [http://localhost/e14/strona/](http://localhost/e14/strona/)
